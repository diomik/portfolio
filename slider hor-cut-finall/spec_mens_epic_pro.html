	<h2>Men's Epic Pro</h2>
	<p>When only the best will do, there's nothing faster than our S-Works Epic. But when you need a race-ready steed that leaves you a bit of change leftover to put towards racing every weekend this season, the Epic Pro steals the show.</p>
	<p>Full fact 11m carbon fiber frame combines stiffness, strength, and light overall weight to deliver an off-the-hook race bike. Meanwhile, the new geometry, RockShox Brain shock, and 100mm of travel, make the Epic the best handling, fastest XC rig you've been on.</p>

	<h2>CLOSEOUT ITEM!!</h2>
	<p>Race courses have evolved over the past few years. They're more technical, steeper, and simply more challenging to ride. Specialized saw this as an opportunity to make something specialâ€”something that both World Cup athletes and XC riders alike can instantly feel the benefit from. They looked at the sum of parts that make a bike handle well, like the head angle, reach, stack, chainstay length, fork offset, etc., and reevaluated all of it. Increasing the reach made a bike that was more stable at speed and generally more comfortable to ride. Dropper posts? Yep, those fit, and not just a short- travel XC option, but full-length droppers that fit in the 30.9mm seat tube. Head angle? That's been slacked that out, but not without evaluating the overall handling package. It now lands on a custom offset, 42mm fork that works with the slacker head angle in order to behave itself in tight corners and through switchbacks. </p>
